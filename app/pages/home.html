title: Welcome to Flattery
---
<p class="lead">Flattery is ready to go!</p>
<p>Start by adding pages to the <code>pages</code> directory! (This page is <code>pages/home.html</code>)</p>
<p>The menu at the top here is the <code>primaryNavigation</code> menu. Edit it in app/data/config/navigation.yml</p>

<h2>Adding users</h2>
<p>
    To add a user, open the directory of flattery in your terminal and run
    <code>php flattery.php users:create</code>. Alternatively, add the user in <code>app/data/users.yml</code>.
</p>

<h2>Custom routes</h2>
<p>
    If you need a page to respond to POST requests for handling form requests, consider defining a route in <code>app/routes.php</code>.
    It works similarly to Laravel - if that's greek to you, it's quite simple:
</p>

<h4>Defining a custom route:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Open <code>app/routes.php</code></li>
    <li>Here, use <code>router()</code> to get Flattery's <code>ThowsenMedia/Flattery/HTTP/Router</code> instance.</li>
    <li>Define routes by calling GET or POST to the router, and giving it a URI and a callback function.</li>
    <li>For example: <code>router()->get('/hello', function() {return 'world!';});</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Theming</h2>
<p>For more advanced usage, you can copy this theme (themes/strappery) to make your own:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Copy themes/strappery to themes/mytheme</li>
    <li>Rename themes/mytheme and
        <ol>
            <li>Rename strappery.php to mytheme.php, and the strappery.yml to mytheme.yml</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Blocks</h2>
<p>
    Blocks are sections of a theme template whose content can be defined either in data/themes/[themename].yml (in the blocks section)
    or by defining the block as a template file in app/blocks/[block_name].php if dynamic content is needed.
</p>

<p>
    To see which blocks are available in a given theme, open the theme's YML file in <code>themes/[theme]/[theme].yml</code>.
</p>

<h2>Plugins</h2>
<p>
    Plugins are stored in <code>/plugins</code>. They consist of a single class file and a yml file. Open up the <code>/plugins</code> and take a look!
